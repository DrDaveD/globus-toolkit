# Globus Job Manager GRD interface script for deleting a job
#
# This script uses information obtained from a file passed as the
# script's argument. This file contains a list of environment variables
# which are set by way of "sourcing" the file from this script. One of
# the evironment variables set as a result of this action is then used
# to obtain the job id for the job to be deleted. Once the job id
# is determined the GRD qdel command is used to delete the job.
