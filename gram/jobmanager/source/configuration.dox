@page globus_gram_job_manager_configuration Job Manager Configuration

The Job Manager is generally configured using the setup-globus-gram-job-manager
setup script. This section of the Job Manager manual describes all options
which may be passed to the GRAM Job Manager in the configuration
file <code>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-job-manager.conf</code>.

@subsection globus_gram_job_manager_configuration_opts Configuration File Options

the argument to this optionis @a always , the file will not be deleted by
the job manager.

GSI. This disables checks for a delegated GSI credential.

@par -home GLOBUS_LOCATION
Set the GLOBUS_LOCATION environment variable to the specified Globus-Location.

@par -type JOB_MANAGER_TYPE

named Perl module in the
<code>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib/perl/Globus/GRAM/JobManager/</code> directory
is needed.

@par -job-reporting-dir PATH
Set the path to the directory to store job status files.

@par -history PATH
Set the path to the directory to store job history files.

@par -publish-jobs

RSL substitutions.

@par -scratch-dir-base PATH
Set the default scratch directory root for the job manager. Job-specific
scratch directories will be created as a subdirectory of this directory.
RSL substitutions (such as $(HOME) and $(LOGNAME)) may be used in this
path. See @ref globus_gram_job_manager_rsl_subs for a list of available
RSL substitutions. If this option is not present in the configuration file,
then the job manager will create scratch directories as subdirectories of
the user's home directory.

@par -globus-host-osname OSNAME
Set the operating system name of the host machine. This will be made available
in the GLOBUS_HOST_OSNAME RSL substitution.

@par -globus-host-osversion OSVERSION
Set the operating system version of the host machine. This will be made

@par -state-file-dir PATH
