/**
@page globus_gram_job_manager_rsl_validation_file RSL Validation File Format

The idea behind the RSL Validation file is to allow the job manager to
determine whether the RSL which the user sends contains only valid RSL
attributes. Valid attributes are defined in a job manager and a scheduler
specific RSL file.

The main purpose of this validation is to allow the job manager add
support for scheduler-specific RSL extensions without having to make
changes to the way the job manager handles job requests internally. As
a side affect, this makes it possible for sites to customize behavior of
Globus started jobs, by providing site-specific defaults for RSL parameters
(such as setting a default queue or project).


Each RSL record consists of a set of pairs of the form
@code
RecordItem: Value
@endcode

Where the value can span multiple lines if it begins with a quote. Records are
separated by a blank line.
RecordItems which are not understood are ignored by the parser.
Currently, the following RecordItems are defined

<dl>
<dt>Attribute</dt>
<dd>The name of the RSL parameter to which this record refers.</dd>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>A textual description of what the RSL parameter means.</dd>
<dt>Default</dt>
<dd>The default value of the RSL parameter if it is not found in the
    RSL. The default value is only used if the DefaultWhen value matches
    the current validation mode.</dd>
<dt>Values</dt>
<dd>A string containing whitespace-separated list of enumerated values
    which are valid for this RSL attribute. For example, for the "dryrun"
    parameter, this may be <b>"yes no"</b>.</dd>
<dt>RequiredWhen</dt>
<dd>Some subset of the "when strings" (* see below), indicating when
    the RSL parameter is required for the RSL to be valid.</dd>
<dt>DefaultWhen</dt>
<dd> Some subset of the "when strings" indicating when then RSL's
     default value will be used if the RSL attribute is not present
     in the RSL.</dd>
<dt>ValidWhen</dt>
<dd>Some subset of the "when strings" indicating when then RSL attribute
    may be used</dd>
</dl>

The job manager supports having multiple validation files, one for the
RSL contexts. Currently, there are two different types of RSL which may be
validated: a job request RSL and a job manager restart RSL. Others may be
defined, for example, to handle the RSL argument passed to a stdio_update
signal. The default validation file for a job submission request is found
in the @ref globus_gram_job_manager_rsl_validation_submit section of the manual.
The default validation file for a job manager restart RSL is found
in the @ref globus_gram_job_manager_rsl_validation_restart section of the
manual.
