@page globus_gram_reporter_configuration GRAM Reporter Configuration

The GRAM Reporter is generally configured using the setup-globus-gram-reporter
setup script. This section of the GRAM Reporter Manager manual describes all
options which may be passed to the GRAM Reporter on the command line.

@subsection globus_gram_reporter_configuration_opts Configuration File Options

@par -conf PATH
Set the path to the jobmanager configuration file.  The gram reporter publishes
some of the values in this file.  It reads the arguments from this file in
addition to other command line arguments.  If the same arguments are found in
the conf file and on the command line, the values from the conf file will
override.

Arguments looked for in the job manager's configuration file include:
   -home
   -globus-gatekeeper-host
   -globus-gatekeeper-port
   -globus-gatekeeper-subject
   -globus-host-manufacturer
   -globus-host-osname
   -globus-host-osversion
   -globus-host-cputype
   -job-reporting-dir
   -machine-type
   -condor-arch
   -condor-os
   
@par -home GLOBUS_LOCATION
Set the GLOBUS_LOCATION environment variable to the specified Globus-Location.

@par -type JOB_MANAGER_TYPE
Set the type of scheduler interface to use for this gram reporter. A similarly
named program is required in the $HOME/libexec/globus-script-<type>-queue shell
script is required.

@par -condor-arch ARCH
Set the condor architecture for this GRAM reporter to be the specified ARCH.
This is required when the job manager type is @a condor.

@par -condor-os OSNAME
Set the condor operating system name for this GRAM reporter to be the specified
OSNAME.  This is required when the job manager type is @a condor.

@par -job-reporting-dir PATH
Set the path to the directory to look for GRAM job status files.

@par -dont-publish-jobs
Job information is published by default.  Use this option if you would like to
not publish job information.

@par -rdn <relative domain name>
This argument uniquely identifies the job manager service for a host.  For
example, if 2 pbs job manager services are installed on a host, the -rdn arg
will uniquely identify them.  -rdn jobmanager-pbs-1 and -rdn jobmanager-pbs-2.

The GRAM reporter uses this argument to construct a complete dn for the MDS
objects.

@par -dmdn <base domain name>
This argument is used as the base dn under which the GRAM reporter objects will
be published.  Typically the base dn for the host object.

@par -keep-to <seconds>
Sets the number of seconds that the objects are valid for.  The default is 600
(15 minutes).

@par -cldif PATH
File path to write the ldif information.  Otherwise the information is printed
to STDOUT.

@par -machine-type
Unused by the GRAM reporter at this time.
