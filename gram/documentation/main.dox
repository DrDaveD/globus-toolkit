@mainpage Globus Resource Allocation Manager (GRAM)

The Globus Resource Allocation Manager (GRAM) processes the requests for
resources for remote application execution, allocates the required resources,
and manages the active jobs. It also returns updated information regarding
the capabilities and availability of the computing resources to the
Metacomputing Directory Service (MDS).

GRAM provides an API for submitting and canceling a job request, as well as
checking the status of a submitted job. The specifications are written by the
user in the Resource Specification Language (RSL), and is processed by GRAM
as part of the job request.
