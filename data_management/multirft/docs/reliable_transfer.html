<h1>Reliable File Transfer Service -Final</h1>
<!-- --------------------------- -->
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The Reliable Transfer Service (RFT) is an OGSA based service that
provides interfaces for controling and monitoring 3rd party file
transfers using GridFTP servers. The client controlling the transfer is
hosted inside of a grid service so it can be managed using the soft
state model and queried using the ServiceData interfaces available to
all grid services. It is esentially a reliable and recoverable version
of the GT2 globus-url-copy tool and more.<!-- --------------------------- --> </p>
<h3>Prerequisites and Dependencies</h3>
<p> The Prerequisites to RFT are: </p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Core Final Distribution</b> 	</li>
  <li><b>GridFTP</b> with a properly configured <b>Host Certificate</b> 	</li>
  <li><b>PostgreSQL</b> </li>
</ul>
<p><b>PostgreSQL</b> is used to store the state of the transfer to allow
for restart after failures. The interface to PostgreSQL is JDBC so any
DBMS that supports JDBC can be used, although no other has been tested. </p>
<p> <b>GridFTP</b> perfoms the actual file transfer. </p>
<p>GridFTP server can only be run on Unix or Linux. There are 2 ways to
get GridFTP: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Packaged with the core GT3 Final installation. </li>
  <li>As part of the Globus Toolkit 2.2 distribution. </li>
</ol>
If you don't already have GridFTP from GT2 installed, use the GT3
bundled version. In either case, configuration instructions are
documented below.<!-- ====================================== -->
<h2>PostgreSQL Setup</h2>
PostgreSQL can be installed both on Unix and on Windows. For detailed
Unix instructions see: <a
 href="http://www3.us.postgresql.org/sitess.html" eudora="AUTOURL">http://www3.us.postgresql.org/sitess.html</a>
and for more detailed Windows instructions see: <a
 href="http://www.ejip.net/faq/postgresql_win_setup_faq.jsp">http://www.ejip.net/faq/postgresql_win_setup_faq.jsp</a>
(Only the first four steps are needed). Here is a summary of what you
need to do after installation:<!-- --------------------------- -->
<h3>Unix Specific Setup</h3>
Login as root.
<pre>    adduser postgres<br>    mkdir /usr/local/pgsql/data<br>    chown postgres /usr/local/pgsql/data<br>    su - postgres<br></pre>
<!-- --------------------------- -->
<h3>Windows Specific Setup</h3>
To run postgreSQL under Windows you need to install <a
 href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a>, and enable at least the
following features:<br>
Database-&gt;postgresql<br>
Utils-&gt;bzip2<br>
Base-&gt;libreadline5<br>
<br>
After installing these components you also need to install CygIPC: <a
 href="http://www.neuro.gatech.edu/users/cwilson/cygutils/cygipc/index.html">http://www.neuro.gatech.edu/users/cwilson/cygutils/cygipc/index.html</a>
<p>Now start the ipc_daemon from a cygwin shell e.g: </p>
<pre>    /cygdrive/c/cygwin/usr/local/bin/ipc-daemon.exe &amp;<p></p>
</pre>
<p>That's it, now you should be able to use psql and postgres as if on
a Unix machine. Note however that you will be using the username
'Administrator' as opposed to 'postgres'</p>
<!-- --------------------------- -->
<h3>Common Setup</h3>
<p>After completing either the Unix or Windows specific setup above do
the following from your user shell (postgres or Administrator). </p>
<pre>    export PGDATA=/usr/local/pgsql/data<br>    initdb<br>    createdb ogsa<br>    psql -d ogsa -f rft_schema_ogsa.sql<br></pre>
(rft_schema_ogsa.sql is provided in the ogsa distribution root, under
the etc directory)
<p> To start the db server run: </p>
<pre>    pgctl -o&nbsp; "-i" -l logfile start<br></pre>
<!-- ====================================== --> <a name="gridftp">
<h2>Configure and Run a GridFTP Server</h2>
</a> Typically two GridFTP servers on separate machines are used to
perform a file transfer. However to perform a simple test of RFT, one
GridFTP server is sufficient. Another alternative is to start two
GridFTP servers on one machine using different ports.
<p> A properly installed <b>Host Certificate</b> is required to run
GridFTP. See the Alpha Admin Guide, Security Configuration for details.<!-- --------------------------- --> </p>
<h3>Run a GridFTP Server</h3>
<b>As root</b>, start a GridFTP server as follows:
<pre>    $GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/in.ftpd -S [-p &lt;port&gt;]<p></p>
</pre>
GLOBUS_LOCATION is an environment variable set to the root directory of
your Globus Core Installation.
<p> The "-S" will send the process to the background. <br>
The -p specifies an available port that GridFTP will listen on. If it's
in use, try another. </p>
<p> <b>Testing GridFTP - Moving a test file</b> </p>
<p>Create a file named <code>/tmp/file1</code> and run the following
command: </p>
<pre>    globus-url-copy -s "`grid-cert-info -subject`" \<br>        gsiftp://localhost:5678/tmp/file1 \<br>        file:///tmp/file2<br></pre>
<p>Check to make sure that /tmp/file2 now exists.<!-- --------------------------- --> </p>
<h3>Configure a GridFTP Server</h3>
<p>If you want a GridFTP server to be started automatically when
requests come in over a particular socket, then configure your system as
follows. Otherwise, this step may be ignored. </p>
<p> If you already have a GT2 GridFTP server installed, skip this step. </p>
<p> Make the following changes to your system as root. </p>
<p>Add this entry to /etc/services: </p>
<pre>   gsiftp  2811/tcp<br></pre>
<p>Depending on whether your host is running inetd or xinetd, you will
need to modify its configuration accordingly. </p>
<ul>
  <p><b>Inetd</b><br>
Add the following entry, all on one line, to /etc/inetd.conf.   Replace
GLOBUS_LOCATION below with the actual value of $GLOBUS_LOCATION in your 
environment. </p>
  <pre>    gsiftp  stream  tcp     nowait  root<br>      /usr/bin/env env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib<br>      GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/in.ftpd -l -a -G GLOBUS_LOCATION<br></pre>
  <p><b>New to 2.2:</b> This entry has changed from the entry provided
for the GridFTP server in the Globus Toolkit 2.0 Administrator's
Guide.&nbsp; The reason is that if you followed the instructions from
the install section, you do not have a static in.ftpd.&nbsp; This
requires you to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that the server can
dynamically link against the libraries in $GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib.&nbsp; To
accomplish the setting of the environment variable in inetd, we use
/usr/bin/env (the location may vary on your system) to first set
LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and then to call in.ftpd itself. </p>
  <p> The advantage of this setup is that when you apply a security
update to your installation, the GridFTP server will pick it up
dynamically without your having to rebuild it. </p>
  <p> <b>Xinetd</b><br>
For xinetd, add a file named "grid-ftp" to the /etc/xinetd.d/ directory
with the following contents. Be sure to replace GLOBUS_LOCATION below
with the actual value of $GLOBUS_LOCATION in your environment. </p>
  <pre>    service gsiftp<br>    {<br>	    instances               = 1000<br>	    socket_type             = stream<br>	    wait                    = no<br>	    user                    = root<br>	    env			    = LD_LIBRARY_PATH=GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib<br>	    server                  = GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/in.ftpd<br>	    server_args             = -l -a -G GLOBUS_LOCATION<br>	    log_on_success         += DURATION USERID<br>	    log_on_failure         += USERID<br>	    nice                    = 10<br>            disable                 = no<br>    }<br></pre>
  <p><b>New to 2.2:</b> This entry has changed from the   entry provided
for the GridFTP server in the Globus Toolkit 2.0 Administrator's
Guide.&nbsp; The reason is that if you followed the instructions from
the install section,   you do not have a static in.ftpd.&nbsp; This
requires you to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH so   that the server can
dynamically link against the libraries in $GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib.&nbsp;
To accomplish the setting of the environment variable in xinetd, we use
the "env   =" option to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH in the gatekeeper's
environment. </p>
  <p>The advantage of this setup is that when you apply a security
update to your   installation, the GridFTP server will pick it up
dynamically without your having to   rebuild it. </p>
</ul>
<p>The -G GLOBUS_LOCATION (remember to substitute your real
GLOBUS_LOCATION) tells the in.ftpd to look for ftpaccess in
$GLOBUS_LOCATION.&nbsp; If you do not specify this flag, the server will
use /etc/ftpaccess. </p>
<p>After you have added the gridftp service to either inetd or xinetd,
notify inetd (or xinetd) that its configuration file has changed as
follows: </p>
<ul>
  <p><b>For Inetd:</b><br>
On most linux systems, you can simply run `killall -HUP inetd` </p>
  <p>On other systems, the following has the same effect: ps aux | grep
inetd | awk '{print   $2;}' | xargs kill -HUP </p>
  <p><b>For Xinetd:</b><br>
On most linux systems, you can simply run `/etc/rc.d/init.d/xinetd
restart` </p>
  <p>On other systems (or if that doesn't work), see man xinetd. </p>
</ul>
<p>GridFTP uses /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile for authorization, just
like GRAM.</p>
<!-- ====================================== -->
<h2>RFT Grid Service Setup</h2>
<p> The Core Alpha distributions includes the a deployable GAR for RFT
named <code>reliabletransfer.gar</code>. </p>
<p>First, set the following parameters in
reliabletransfer-server-config.wsdd: <br>
<b>&nbsp;JdbcDriver</b> : Name of the JDBC Driver for the database you
want to use. For a PostgreSQL installation as described above this value
is: org.postgresql.Driver. The driver is shipped along with our
distribution.<br>
<b>connectionURL</b>: URL for the Database in order make the
connection. For postgres this is jdbc:postgresql:&lt;db&gt;, and in our
example above it would be jdbc:postgresql:ogsa <br>
<b>username</b>: Local user with access to the database. (On windows
this would be Administrator) <br>
<b>password</b>: Password set up to access the database for the
particular user. </p>
<p> Deploy the gar by running the following command in $GLOBUS_LOCATION:</p>
<pre>    ant -f build-packages.xml deployGar -Dgar.name=&lt;location of multirft.gar&gt;<br></pre>
<h3>Build the GAR from Source Distribution</h3>
This step is optional.
<p> If you downloaded the RFT source code then you can make a deployable
gar file as follows: <br>
Change the ogsacore.javadir property in build.xml to point to
ogsa/impl/java directory in your  ogsa installation (or you can override
the default property by doing  ant -Dogsacore.dir=&lt;your ogsa
installation&gt; compile) <br>
Run: </p>
<pre>    cd data_management/multirft<br>    ant deployGar<br></pre>
This builds a gar that can be deployed in a service container. Now
update the reliabletransfer-server-config.wsdd and deploy the GAR as
described above.<!-- ====================================== -->
<h2>Testing the RFT Service using the Command Line Client</h2>
1. Deploy multirft.gar<br>
<pre>source setenv.sh<br><br></pre>
2. you can provide the list of transfers in the form of a file. The
format of the file is as follows :<br>
(the #comments are provided for explanation of the parameters and
should not be included in the transfers list )<br>
<br>
true #type of transfer true=binary false=ascii<br>
16000 &nbsp;#block size in bytes<br>
16000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #TCP buffer size in bytes<br>
false&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #Notpt <br>
1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # Number of parallel streams<br>
true&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #DCAU<br>
1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #Concurrency<br>
