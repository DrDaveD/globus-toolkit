Install globus-url-sync, from source:

  Before building globus-urlsync from source, install the Globus Toolkit.

  Set the $GLOBUS_LOCATION environment variable.

  Using your standard login, check out "gass/sync" from cvs:
	$ cvs -d \
            :pserver:anonymous@cvs.globus.org:/home/globdev/CVS/globus-packages \
            co gass/sync

  Change the ownership, so that binary can be installed in "$GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin":
	$ sudo -R chown globus:globus gass
	$ sudo su globus

  As user "globus", substituting the flavor of your Globus Toolkit installation 
  for "gcc64dbgpthr":
	cd gass/sync/library/source/
	./bootstrap
	$GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/gpt-build -verbose -force gcc64dbgpthr
	cd ../../client/source/
	./bootstrap
	$GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/gpt-build -verbose -force gcc64dbgpthr

Note: 
----

o GSI user credentials are needed too run globus-url-sync.

o Also, a GridFTP server must be running on both the source and the 
  destination endpoints.

o See globus-url-sync -help for available options.

Known limitations:
-----------------

o If the source directory hierarchy contains directories not present in
  the destination directory hierarchy, globus-url-copy must be invoked
  with the -cd (create directory) option.

o Empty directories, anywhere in the source directory hierarchy, are not
  currently handled, and will not be mentioned in the list of files to be
  transferred using globus-url-copy.

o Performance may be slow until it's been optimized to take advantage of
  some new GridFTP features.

o The -modify option:
  - Timezones are not taken into account.
  - Timestamps are matched exactly, so files on systems that are not
    time-synchronized will never match.
  - In the future an inexact matching feature may be added.

o Authentication errors may be erroneously be reported as though a file
  is missing.

o Order of options does not currently effect order in which matching 
  criteria are evaluated.

o Man-page for globus-url-sync is not automatically installed as part of
  the build process.
