Install globus-url-sync, from source:

  Before building globus-urlsync from source, install the Globus Toolkit.

  Set the $GLOBUS_LOCATION environment variable.

  globus-url-sync was initially released as part of Globus Toolkit 5.0.1.
  The following should be necessary only if an earlier version of Globus Toolkit 
  has been installed:
      Using your standard login, check out "gass/sync" from cvs:
	$ cvs -d \
            :pserver:anonymous@cvs.globus.org:/home/globdev/CVS/globus-packages \
            co gass/sync

      Change the ownership, so that binary can be installed in "$GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin":
	$ sudo -R chown globus:globus gass
	$ sudo su globus

  To get the most recent version of globus-url-sync:
      Using your standard login, update "gass/sync" from cvs:
	$ cvs -d \
            :pserver:anonymous@cvs.globus.org:/home/globdev/CVS/globus-packages \
            update gass/sync

  If globus-url-sync has been newly checked out or updated, build it:
      As user "globus", substituting the flavor of your Globus Toolkit installation 
      for "gcc64dbgpthr":
	cd gass/sync/library/source/
	./bootstrap
	$GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/gpt-build -verbose -force gcc64dbgpthr
	cd ../../client/source/
	./bootstrap
	$GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/gpt-build -verbose -force gcc64dbgpthr


Piping from globus-url-sync to globus_url_copy
------ ---- --------------- -- ---------------

For example:

  globus-url-sync -r -s gsiftp://host.edu//tmp/dir1 gsiftp://host.edu//tmp/dir2 \
       | globus-url-copy -cd -r -f -


Note: 
----

o GSI user credentials are needed to run globus-url-sync.

o Also, a GridFTP server must be running on both the source and the 
  destination endpoints.

o See globus-url-sync -help for available options.

Known limitations:
-----------------

o globus‐url‐sync currently includes files that globus‐url‐copy may not
  be able to read, as part of its output.  If output is piped to the
  globus.org "xfer" command, the transfer of these files may be retried
  without succeeding.

o globus-url-copy should be invoked with the "-r" and the "-cd" options,
  so that directories can be copied recursively (for "globus-url-sync -r"),
  and so that directories at the destination can be created.

o Until globus.org supports the recursive copying of directories, when 
  globus‐url‐sync output is being piped into a globus.org "xfer" command, 
  the globus‐url‐sync ‐g and ‐r options should not be used at the same time.

o Authentication errors may be erroneously be reported as though a file
  is missing.

o Order of options does not currently effect order in which matching 
  criteria are evaluated.

o Man-page for globus-url-sync is not automatically installed as part of
  the build process.
