.SH NAME
globus-url-sync \- URL Synchronization
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B globus-url-sync
[-help | -usage] [-version] [-d | -v] [-c] [-r] [-m] [-s] [-t] <sourceURL> <destURL>
.SH SUMMARY
The program
.B globus-url-sync
compares two endpoints, using GridFTP, and prints a list of GSI file transfers 
that should be performed using 
.B globus-url-copy
with options 
.B -r
and
.B -cd,
e.g. "globus-url-copy -r -cd".
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -help | -usage
Print help text.
.TP
.B -version
Print the version of this program.
.TP
.B -d | -debug | -v | -verbose
Print additional detail.
.TP
.B -c | -connection-caching-off
Disable GridFTP client connection caching, which is enabled by default.
.TP
.B -r | -recursive-dir-copy\n
Output directory names, when an entire directory is to be copied recursively.
This option may be used to improve performance, particularly when the 
destination is being populated for the first time.  This option should also 
be used when an empty directory is to be copied, as the default configuration, 
which lists complete file pathnames, will not list a pathname of an empty directory.
.TP
.B -m | -modify
Compare files by last modified timestamp.
.TP
.B -s | -size
Compare files by size.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The current implementation of 
.B globus-url-sync
supports very basic features for directory synchronization.  It includes comparators 
for existence checks, file size checks, modification timestamp checks, but not 
checksum comparison.
.sp
URL scheme(s) supported:
.sp
.B gsiftp
.nf
    For example:
      File name, absolute path: "gsiftp://myhost.edu//tmp/file1"
                                "gsiftp://myhost.edu/~/file1"
      File name, relative path: "gsiftp://myhost.edu/file1"
      Directory, absolute path: "gsiftp://myhost.edu//tmp/dir1/"
.fi
.sp
.B sshftp
.nf
    For example:
      File name, absolute path: "sshftp://myhost.edu//tmp/file1"
                                "sshftp://myhost.edu/~/file1"
      File name, relative path: "sshftp://myhost.edu/file1"
      Directory, absolute path: "sshftp://myhost.edu//tmp/dir1/"
.fi
.SH BUGS
This is an early version of 
.B globus-url-sync.
In the event that unexpected results are returned, please re-run the command with the 
.B -verbose 
option.
.P
.B Known limitations:
.P 1
Performance may be slow until it's been optimized to take advantage of
some new GridFTP features.
.P 1
The
.B -modify 
option:
.nf
  - Timezones are not taken into account.
  - Timestamps are matched exactly, so files on systems that are not 
    time-synchronized will never match.
  - In the future an inexact matching feature may be added.
.fi
.P 1
Authentication errors may be erroneously be reported as though a file is missing.
.P 1
Order of options does not currently effect order in which matching criteria are evaluated.
.P 1
Man-page for globus-url-sync is not automatically installed as part of the build process.
