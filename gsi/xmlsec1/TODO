- Unify password callback (one of parameters: filename)
- Windows, nmake check.
    1) I would like to execute test suite for all available 
    xmlsec-crypto libs on Windows (in the same way as we do it on Linux). 
    2) Since the working directory is xmlsec/win32, instead of
    xmlsec, some files with keys are not found. (Causes raw-cert
    sig test to fail, for example.)
    3) Thirdly the command diff is used, but this may result into
    finding differences in files simply because of the original
    file may have lf and the newly generated files have crlf as
    linebreaks.
    5) Create platform independent test files format and generate
    test*.sh, test*.bat, etc scripts "on the fly".
