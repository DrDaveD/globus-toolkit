The files in this directory are used to create globus binary packages of the
sasl distribution.

filelist - contain a list of installed files. It can be regenerated by
going into the top of the installation directory and typing:

find . -type f > filelist

The list has to be hand edited to remove the "./" from each entry.

patches - is a directory containing patch files (if any).  The layout and names
of the directories match the actual distribution.  For example patches
to the file "tools/Makefile.sasl" would be found in the file
"patches/tools/Makefile.sasl"

pkg_data_src.gpt - is the packaging metadata file.  It contains the
package dependencies, name, package version and other information.


Building sasl binary packages:

1. Get the source tarball and put it in the top level directory.
   ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/cyrus-mail/BETA/cyrus-sasl-1.5.27.tar.gz

2. Untar the source tarball.  globus-build can do this for you but it
   takes forever.

3. Decide which of your build flavors need threaded binaries.  These flavors
   need to have macros set at the globus-build command line.  For example,
   if you have a flavor "foo" that is threaded then the macro
   "foo_CONFIGOPTS_GPTMACRO="threads" needs to be added. This allows you to
   sync the sasl configuration stage to your build flavors.

4. Invoke globus-build by typing

   globus-build <threaded_flavor>_CONFIGOPTS_GPTMACRO="threads" \
                CONFIGOPTS_GPTMACRO="shared" <list of flavors> 

You can also use:

--verbose if you want to see what the script is doing.

--tmpdir=<DIR> if you want sasl to be installed somewhere other than tmp

--install-only If you just want sasl installed. No binary packages.
