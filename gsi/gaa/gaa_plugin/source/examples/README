The gss-server and gss-client programs are modified versions of the
programs in ../../Security/tests.  To use them, first create a
configuration file to configure GAA for the gss-server program (an
example config file is in ../gaa/gaa_plugin/examples/gaa.linux.cf).
Make sure all the pathnames (for the directories where callback
libraries, EACLs, and group files are found) are correct.  Then invoke
the server program as:

  ./gss-server -cf <config_file>

and the client as:

  ./gss-client <gss-server host> <gss-server credential identity>

Several commands can be specified to gss-client:

  print sc		print GAA security context
  getpolicy <file>	Read policy information from the EACL contained
                        in <policydir>/<file> (where <policydir> is the
                        directory specified in the config file used by
                        gss-server).
  print policy		print the current policy
  request <auth> <val>  request the right described by the specified
                        authority and value (e.g. "request file read").
  assert <name>         if the assertion mechanism is specified in the
                        gss-server configuration file, add an assertion
                        credential (with the specified name) to the security
                        context.
  clear sc		clear the GAA security context.
