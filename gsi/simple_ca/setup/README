The globus_simple_ca_setup package is a little different from the
rest, hence the extra documentation.  

The bootstrap command (if enabled) generates a "templated
package" (globus_simple_ca_setup_template) as a tarball, 
which gets added to the globus_simple_ca_setup package 
(a package in a package).  When the globus_simple_ca_setup package
is installed (actually happens at postinstall time), the
templated setup package is modified to a CA specific setup package
(much like the old ssl_utils_setup package), which can be distributed
to (and installed by) all the users of that CA.

In order to modify the templated package, the files in the template
directory must be modified and the tarball regenerated.  To recreate
the tarball, just do 'make dist' as usual.  
This will run the dist-hook in the globus_automake_simpleca_post_top file.  
The files that go into the tarball are listed
in the template_list file.  The template file should be updated in the 
cvs repository.

Since its just a template, you won't be able to use any of the build
commands (bootstrap, configure, make) in the template directory, so don't
try.  What you can do is install the globus_simple_ca_setup package, run
the postinstall script (the setup-simple-ca script) in $GLOBUS_LOCATION/setup/globus/setup-simple-ca, and have it generate a unique CA package.  Then
you can modify this package as you see fit, test it, and put the resulting
changes back in the templated package.
