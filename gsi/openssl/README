These files are used to insert openssl into a globus installation. 


The file openssl.gvp is a virtual package metadata file.  It is used
to create symlinks from a previously installed openssl distribution to
a globus installation using the script globus-virtual-package.

The remaining files are used to create globus binary packages of the
openssl distribution.

filelist - contain a list of installed files. It can be regenerated by
going into the top of the installation directory and typing:

find . -type f > filelist

The list has to be hand edited to remove the "./" from each entry.

patches - is a directory containing patch files.  The layout and names
of the directories match the actual distribution.  For example patches
to the file "tools/Makefile.ssl" would be found in the file
"patches/tools/Makefile.ssl"

pkg_data_src.gpt - is the packaging metadata file.  It contains the
package dependencies, name, package version and other information.


Building openssl binary packages:

1. Get the source tarball from opensource.org and put it in the top
level directory.

2. Untar the source tarball.  globus-build can do this for you but it
takes forever.

3. Decide which of your build flavors need threaded binaries.  These
flavors need to have macros set at the globus-build command line.  For
example if you have a flavor "foo" that is threaded then the macro
"foo_CONFIGOPTS_GPTMACRO="threads" needs to be added. This allows you
to sync the openssl configuration stage to your build flavors.

4. Invoke globus-build by typing

globus-build <threaded_flavor>_CONFIGOPTS_GPTMACRO="threads" CONFIGOPTS_GPTMACRO="shared" <list of flavors> 

You can also use:

--verbose if you want to see what the script is doing.

--tmpdir=<DIR> if you want openssl to be installed somewhere other than tmp

--install-only If you just want openssl installed. No binary packages.
