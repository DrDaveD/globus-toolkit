Security/tests/README

Configure globus --with-security-tests to build these tests.

gss-client and gss-server come from the MIT Kerberos 5 distribution.

gss-assist-client currently doesn't work.

test-client-cert and test-server-cert are certificates for testing
signed by a bogus CA whose cert is in test-certdir. Currently the
actual CA key is on my desktop machine, which is ok since the
testing stuff is the only thing that uses this CA so it can be
easily replaced.

Note that with a globus-install installation that the binaries in
this directory and in Security/gssapi_ssleay must be made. This
means these tests will only run successfully in the tools portion
of the build and not in development or services (unless you make
the binaries by hand in the two directories).
