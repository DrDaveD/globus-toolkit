Since future GRAM adapters may not need the SEG, this should be divorced from
the JSM.  I've already made the JobStateMonitor class an interface with the old
code moved to SchedulerEventGeneratorMonitor (i.e. a SEG-specific job state
monitor).  In addition to this, the directory structure should change to the
following:

job_monitoring
    - common
        - java
            - source (JobStateMonitor, etc...)
    -seg
        - java
            - source (SchdedulerEventGeneratorMonitor, etc...)
        - c
            - source (scheduler-event-generator)
            - condor (condor seg module)
            - fork (fork seg module)
            - job-manager (GT2 equivalent of the SEG Monitor)
            - lsf (lsf seg module)
            - pbs (pbs seg module)
