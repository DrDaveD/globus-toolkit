    - RIPS (current)
      Periodically polling pbs queue via qstat, correlating queue ID presence
      with it being pending or active. when not present any longer, consider
      it done. jm subscribes to rips, dummy placeholder state
      is inserted into rips's queue state information until the next poll
      which will indicate job state changes.
      - high execution overhead polling queue
      - high memory overhead keeping state information for all jobs
      - not event driven.
      - no indication when jobs are cancelled or abort
    - polling in script (Job manager)
      Periodically polling pbs queue via qstat, correlating queue ID presence
      with it being pending or active
      - high overhead (one process polling entire queue per job)
      - no indication when jobs are cancelled or abort, or way to reap exit
        codes
    - Following server_logs files
      - Logs may have different information in them depending on site config
      - Logs are named by date
      - Could job state span multiple logs for jobs started near end of day or
        which run for very long periods?
      - logs may include job starting, exit code, resources used. Is this
        configurable by the site?
      - what permissions might the logs have?
    - Email notifications
      - pbs can send notification emails for when a job is aborted by batch 
        system, begins execution, or terminates. termination email contains
        resource usage and exit code.
      - is local email usually configured on scheduler front-end system?
      - can we convince admins to install something like procmail or a
        .forward pipe to handle these emails?
      - do we care about insecurity of email? potential disk full or other
        problems which could cause email notifications to fail?
    - Direct notifications to PBS
      - can we modify the openpbs source or convince the pbs authors to
        include some other notification mechanism besides email? Presumably
        the email hooks they have would be a good clue into where to insert
        such notifications. What sort of license issues would this entail?
        What would be our ideal method of delivering notifications be in
        this case?
