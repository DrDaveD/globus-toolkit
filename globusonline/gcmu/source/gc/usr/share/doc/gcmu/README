Globus Connect Multi-User packages a GridFTP server, MyProxy server and MyProxy
Online CA pre-configured for use with Globus Online and only requires a few
steps to install and use.

GCMU is designed for multi-user servers, and will typically be installed by
a system administrator. If you would like to add your personal laptop or desktop
machine to Globus Online, please use one of the Globus Connect versions
available at https://www.globusonline.org/globus_connect/ for your specific
operating system.




Prerequisites:

You need a machine (with root privileges) that
 - Runs a supported Linux distribution GCMU is currently tested on Debian 6,
   Centos 5 and 6, Ubuntu 10.04, 10.10, 11.04, 11.10, and 12.04,
   Fedora 16 and 17

Load your ssh public key into your Globus Online account (one-time action)
 - Sign in to Globus Online (if you do not have an account, create one at
   https://www.globusonline.org/SignUp)
 - Select "My Account" from the Go To drop down box
 - Click "Manage Identities" in left column, then click "Add SSH Public Key"
 - Paste the contents of your SSH public key into the "SSH Public Key" field
   (you can optionally enter any name you like in the "Alias" field) and click
   "Add SSH Key". (It will take 1-2 minutes for the SSH key to become active
   for use.)
 - Make sure you can logon to GO CLI from the machine where you are installing
   GCMU by doing 'ssh <Your-GO-Username>@cli.globusonline.org'

Firewall
 - If you have a firewall that restricts inbound connections, ports 7512, 2811
   and 50000-51000 (or alternate ports) must be opened for inbound connections.




To install, reinstall or reconfigure GCMU, as root, run the command
# /usr/share/gcmu/install

The script will ask for all the required information, connect to Globus Online,
obtain X.509 certificates, configure the environment, run a GridFTP server and
a MyProxy server with MyProxy CA and make the GridFTP server available as
an endpoint on Globus Online. 

Root privileges are needed to copy xinetd configuration files for GridFTP and
MyProxy server and restart xinetd daemon. 

To stop all GCMU services (GridFTP server and MyProxy server),
and uninstall GCMU by removing all files, run

# /usr/share/gcmu/uninstall
