The GSI-OpenSSH development team announces the release of version 3.0 of
the GSI-Enabled OpenSSH software distribution.  GSI-OpenSSH 3.0 is based
on OpenSSH 3.7.1p2 and NCSA's latest GSI patch for that version of
OpenSSH.  A summary of the major changes found in this version is given
at the end of this document.

In response to interest members of the user community have shown in 
a mode where GSI-OpenSSH does not override a previously-installed system 
SSH, we have redesigned the main package so that the default behaviour is 
to make available in $GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin/ only the commands 'gsissh', 
'gsisftp', and 'gsiscp'.  Those users who wish for GSI-OpenSSH to also 
install 'ssh' and the rest of the standard SSH commands into 
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin/ should add the new "compatibility package" 
onto their installation.

It is our understanding that OpenSSH 3.8 will soon be released.  We would 
solicit feedback on our package's new structure and will incorporate 
useful comments and suggestions (perhaps when we address moving to OpenSSH 
3.8).

GSI-OpenSSH 3.0 Major changes

   New features

      * Moved to OpenSSH 3.7.1p2 codebase.

      * Removed GSSAPI support for protocol 1.

      * Added NCSA_GSSAPI comment in version string to help identify 
        OpenSSH versions with NCSA patches for debugging purposes.

      * Added gsisftp install target.

      * Enable -static to link statically with Globus GSI libraries.  
        YMMV.

   Bugs fixed

      * Fixed bug where client would attempt external-keyx even when 
        GSSAPI key exchange was not performed, causing compatibility 
        problems between GSSAPI mechanisms.

      * Fixed misleading "Protocol error: didn't expect packet type 34" 
        message.  Changed to "packet type 35".
