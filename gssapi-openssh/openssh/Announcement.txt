GSI-OpenSSH 4.7 Major changes

   New features

      * Configure $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/ssh/ssh_config to enable only
        GSSAPI authentication methods on the client-side, so other
        methods (such as password or public key) aren't attempted when
        GSI authentication fails. We expect users to select a standard
        ssh client (rather than gsissh) for those methods. The server
        still supports all methods by default to support both GSI and
        non-GSI clients.

      * Updated to 20090726 patch from Simon Wilkinson
        (http://www.sxw.org.uk/computing/patches/openssh.html) which
        adds support for cascading credentials.
        https://bugzilla.mcs.anl.gov/globus/show_bug.cgi?id=6785

      * Add support for PAM user switching when "PermitPAMUserChange
        yes" is set in $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/ssh/sshd_config.
        https://bugzilla.mcs.anl.gov/globus/show_bug.cgi?id=6839

      * Update to HPN13V6
        (http://www.psc.edu/networking/projects/hpn-ssh/) excluding
        multi-threaded AES-CTR support due to unresolved problem that
        causes the cipher to hang.

   Bugs fixed

      * None.
