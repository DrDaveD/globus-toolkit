GSI-OpenSSH 3.0 Major changes

   New features

      * Moved to OpenSSH 3.7.1p2 codebase.

      * Removed GSSAPI support for protocol 1.

      * Added NCSA_GSSAPI comment in version string to help identify 
        OpenSSH versions with NCSA patches for debugging purposes.

      * Added gsisftp install target.

      * Enable -static to link statically with Globus GSI libraries.  

   Bugs fixed

      * Fixed bug where client would attempt external-keyx even when 
        GSSAPI key exchange was not performed, causing compatibility 
        problems between GSSAPI mechanisms.

      * Fixed misleading "Protocol error: didn't expect packet type 34" 
        message.
