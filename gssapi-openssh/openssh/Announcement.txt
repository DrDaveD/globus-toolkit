   New features

      * Moved to OpenSSH 4.2p1.

      * Incorporated openssh-4.2p1-gsskex-20050926-2.patch from Simon
        Wilkinson adding support for gssapi-keyex authentication
        method (http://www.sxw.org.uk/computing/patches/openssh.html).

Please note that the configure script included in OpenSSH 4.2p1 checks
ZLIB_VERSION in zlib.h for zlib versions with known vulnerabilities.
See <http://www.zlib.net/> for details on zlib vulnerabilities.  The
current acceptable versions of zlib are 1.1.4 and 1.2.3.  In cases
where your vendor has not provided a secure version of zlib, please
install the latest version of zlib in an alternate path and set the
--with-zlib GSI_OPENSSH_GPTMACRO option.  For example:

  gpt-build -verbose gsi_openssh_bundle-3.6-src.tar.gz gcc32dbg \
    GSI_OPENSSH_GPTMACRO="--with-zlib=/usr/local/zlib-1.2.3"
