GSI-OpenSSH 4.7 Major changes

   New features

      * Configure $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/ssh/ssh_config to enable only
        GSSAPI authentication methods on the client-side, so other
        methods (such as password or public key) aren't attempted when
        GSI authentication fails. We expect users to select a standard
        ssh client (rather than gsissh) for those methods. The server
        still supports all methods by default to support both GSI and
        non-GSI clients.

   Bugs fixed
