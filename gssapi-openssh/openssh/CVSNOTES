  [ Generic Tag Merging ]

    1. Set up your environment to point to the correct CVS repository.

          $ export CVSROOT="/afs/ncsa/projects/globus/Repository"

    2. Commit any locally-modified files and tag the repository before the merge.

          $ cvs commit
          $ cvs tag <tagName>-premerge

    2. Merge the changes from your original base merge point to your new base merge
       point.

          $ cvs update -kk -j<originalBase> -j<newBase>

    3. Retrieve a list of any conflicts that were discovered as a result of the
       merge.

          $ cvs -n update | grep C

    4. Resolve all of the conflicts in each of the listed files.

    5. Commit all of the files in your working directory to the repository and tag
       the repository.

          $ cvs commit
          $ cvs tag <tagName>-merged

  [ History ]

    2002/09/23
    ----------
      Action: Merge
        - occurred on: GPT branch (OPENSSH_3_1P1_GSSAPI_GPT-branch)
        - original base: OPENSSH_3_4P1_GSI_20020701
        - new base: OPENSSH_3_4P1_GSI_20020923
      Conflicts: 1
        - configure.ac
            resolved by ignoring mainline changes and keeping the text that was
            originally in the file on this branch.  (We require a specified flavor type
            where the trunk can compensate in that case.)
