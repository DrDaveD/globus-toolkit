CVSNOTES
========

This file contains notes regarding the files stored in the openssh CVS 
module that contains the GSI-OpenSSH code.  Consider it a living document.

  [ Generic Tag Merging ]

    <newBase> refers to the new tag that lives in the repository.  
    Supposedly, you are undergoing a cvs merge because a new GSI patch has 
    been created (along with a new corresponding tag).

    1. Set up your environment to point to the correct CVS repository.

          $ export CVSROOT="<username>@cvs.ncsa.uiuc.edu:/CVS/gssapi-openssh"

    2. Commit any locally-modified files.

          $ cvs update
          $ cvs commit

    3. Tag the repository before the merge.

          $ cvs tag <newBase>_GPT-premerge

    4. Merge the changes from your original base merge point to your new 
       base merge point.

          $ cvs update -kk -jOPENSSH_GSI_GPT_BASE -j<newBase>

    5. Retrieve a list of any conflicts that were discovered as a result 
       of the merge.

          $ cvs -n update | grep C

    6. Resolve all of the conflicts in each of the listed files.

    7. Add an entry to the History section of this file detailing your 
       merge action, along with noting conflicts that occurred and any 
       interesting changes you had to make to resolve them.

    8. Move OPENSSH_GSI_GPT_BASE.

          $ cvs rtag -F -r <newBase> OPENSSH_GSI_GPT_BASE openssh

    9. Commit all of the files in your working directory to the 
       repository and tag the working directory as merged.

          $ cvs commit
          $ cvs tag <newBase>_GPT-merged

      Conflicts: 4
        - ChangeLog
	    Old log entries were trimmed in the 3.8.1p1 release.
	    Not sure why this generated a conflict.
        - configure.ac
	    Copyright statement added to head of configure.ac, which
	    generated a conflict due to nearby $Id$ evil.
        - session.c
	    We do child_set_env("GLOBUS_LOCATION") on the branch, and
            this conflicted with the child_set_env("LIBPATH") changes
            on the trunk.  Merged in child_set_env("GLOBUS_LOCATION")
	    with the new code.
        - version.h
	    Should always get a conflict here on version changes.
	    Bumped version to OpenSSH_3.8.1P1 NCSA_GSSAPI_GPT_3.3.

      Action: Merge

        - new base: OPENSSH_3_8P1_GSSAPI_20040304
      Conflicts: 3
        - Makefile.in
            acss.o added to LIBSSH_OBJS in OpenSSH release.
	    conflicted because of nearby comment about LIBSSH_OBJS on
	    gpt-branch.
        - configure.ac
	    bugfix on trunk ('==' should be '=') in globus-static
	    section conflicted because earlier line differs between
	    trunk and gpt-branch.
	    code to add -lcrypto to $LIBS conflicted because base
            OpenSSH change moved -lcrypto before $LIBS and trunk and
            gpt-branch differed on whitespace.  accepted trunk version
            with same whitespace to avoid future conflicts.
	    OpenSSH base pid-dir code changed, causing conflict
            because we drop this code on gpt-branch, as we want
            pid-dir set at run-time based on $GL, not configure time.
        - version.h
            OpenSSH base version changed and patch version spec
            conflicts with GPT version spec.  accepted OpenSSH base
            version change and incremented GPT version spec to 3.1.
            this will probably conflict every time from now on.

            cvs choked on my changes to the globus additions.  wasn't a "real" conflict.

        - configure.ac
            resolved by ignoring mainline changes and keeping the text that was
            originally in the file on this branch.  (We require a specified flavor type
            where the trunk can compensate in that case.)
