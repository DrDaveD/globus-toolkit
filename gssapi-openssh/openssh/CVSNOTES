CVSNOTES
========

This file contains notes regarding the files stored in the openssh CVS module that
contains the GSI-OpenSSH code.  Consider it a living document.

  [ Generic Tag Merging ]

    <newBase> refers to the new tag that lives in the repository.  Supposedly, you
    are undergoing a cvs merge because a new GSI patch has been created (along with
    a new corresponding tag).  Let <tagName> be the string "<newBase>_GPT".

    1. Set up your environment to point to the correct CVS repository.

          $ export CVSROOT="<username>@cvs.ncsa.uiuc.edu:/CVS/gssapi-openssh"

    2. Commit any locally-modified files and tag the repository before the merge.

          $ cvs update
          $ cvs commit
          $ cvs tag <tagName>-premerge

    2. Merge the changes from your original base merge point to your new base merge
       point.

          $ cvs update -kk -jOPENSSH_GSI_GPT_BASE -j<newBase>

    3. Retrieve a list of any conflicts that were discovered as a result of the
       merge.

          $ cvs -n update | grep C

    4. Resolve all of the conflicts in each of the listed files.

    5. Commit all of the files in your working directory to the repository and tag
       the repository.

          $ cvs commit
          $ cvs rtag -F -r <newBase> OPENSSH_GSI_GPT_BASE openssh

    6. Add an entry to the History section of this file detailing your merge action,
       along with noting conflicts that occurred and any interesting changes you had
       to make to resolve them.

    7. Commit your change to this file to the repository and tag the working directory
       as merged.

          $ cvs commit
          $ cvs tag <tagName>-merged

            cvs choked on my changes to the globus additions.  wasn't a "real" conflict.

        - configure.ac
            resolved by ignoring mainline changes and keeping the text that was
            originally in the file on this branch.  (We require a specified flavor type
            where the trunk can compensate in that case.)
