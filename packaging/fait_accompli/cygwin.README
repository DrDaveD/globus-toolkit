cygwin support currently requires converting selected xio plugin drivers into xio builtin drivers.

move cygwin.patch to ../patches/.
move cygwin.script.sh to ../scripts/.
run fait_accompli/installer.sh as usual.
build the resulting installer on cygwin 1.7 or higher.
run cygwin.bundle to create a binary zip package.
