Required software
    * JDK 1.4.2+
    * Ant 1.5+ (do not use the ant in Fedora Core 2)
    * C compiler. If gcc, avoid version 3.2.  3.2.1 and 2.95.x are okay.
    * GNU tar
    * JDBC compliant database. For instance, postgres 7.1+

Optional software:
    * IODBC (for RLS.  For instance, version 3.0.5)
    * Tomcat (for WSRF container)
    * junit (for java unit tests)

Installing GT 3.9.3
===================
First, download the required software.  Be aware that apache ant
will use the java referred to by JAVA_HOME, not necessarily the first
java executable on your PATH.  Be sure to set JAVA_HOME to the
top-level directory of your java installation before installing.

If you want to build RLS, set GLOBUS_IODBC_PATH to point to the
directory containing the IODBC driver.  If you do not, the build of
RLS will be skipped.

Create a user named "globus". As the globus user, run

globus$ export GLOBUS_LOCATION=/usr/local/globus-3.9.3
globus$ ./install-wsrf $GLOBUS_LOCATION

You may replace "/usr/local/globus-3.9.3" with whatever directory you
wish to install to.

Then see http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/development/3.9.3/
for setup details.


Installing optional bundles
===========================
The schedulers/ and tests/ subdirectories contain optional bundles of
software.  If you are installing on a machine that has the submission
software for PBS, LSF, or Condor already installed, you may install the
corresponding schedulers/gt4-gram-<scheduler>-3.9-src_bundle.tar.gz file.
To do this, run:

$ export GLOBUS_LOCATION=/usr/local/globus-3.9.3
$ $GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/gpt-build schedulers/gt4-gram-<scheduler>-3.9-src_bundle.tar.gz

If you want to install the test bundles, you will need to install junit.
Then you may run:
$ export GLOBUS_LOCATION=/usr/local/globus-3.9.3
$ $GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/gpt-build tests/*.tar.gz
