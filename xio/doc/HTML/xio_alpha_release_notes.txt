Globus XIO
----------

The long awaited Globus XIO library is ready for alpha release.  Globus XIO 
is an extensible input/output library for the Globus Toolkit (TM).   
For this and future releases of the Globus Toolkit the globus_xio library 
will provide all input and output functionality.
 
Globus XIO will replaces the globus_io library.  A portability layer is 
included with the release so legacy applications written to globus_io will
be supported, however it is recommended that future applications code straight
to the globus_xio API.

For more information on the globus_xio see:

Features:
- simple intuitive open/close/read/write API.
- swappable IO implementations.
- simple API to many different types of IO.

Current driver implementations:
-------------------------------
transport drivers:
- tcp
- udp
- file

transform drivers:
- gsi
- gssapi_ftp
- ftp_cmd
- http

Known issues:
- framework has a bug that appears when a fast processor is heavily loaded
  yet the system performs IO operation extremely quickly.  
  This bug only appears in threaded builds of Globus, and is actively being 
  pursued.
