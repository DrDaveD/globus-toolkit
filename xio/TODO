contact string details

reexamine build process

remove context from transport and hide context else where

drivers should take globus_url_t instead of string contact string

need clean method of getting contact string

need a kickout utility for drivers so their driver specific cntls can respect callback space

po canceled by driver then op bounces down bug

need to add driver_attr_cntl also

Roland whispers to you, "attr_cntl, server_cnt, target_cntl, handle_cntl, read and write should all be passed containter structs instead of void *.  target_init, server_init, open should be passed an attr_t instead of the void *.  we need driver_attr_cntl, driver_target_cntl, driver_handle_cntl and driver_server_cntl"
Roland whispers to you, "ok, thats the list... no more!!!"
