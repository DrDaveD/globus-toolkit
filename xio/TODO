reexamine build process

need clean method of getting contact string

need a kickout utility for drivers so their driver specific cntls can respect callback space

need to check for sysconf for system driver, otherwise we're going to have a 256 fd limit

1) add _client_init() that can be called from acept interface
3) fix race 
4) Add driver operation cancel, for ANY op
   -- it takes context, if op is not greater than context, then fail
6) add globus_assert(result != success || prev_res == success)
