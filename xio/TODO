reexamine build process

remove context from transport and hide context else where

need clean method of getting contact string

need a kickout utility for drivers so their driver specific cntls can respect callback space

po canceled by driver then op bounces down bug

need to add driver_attr_cntl also

Pass Accept, get back,  pass_open, get back, pass_read... does that work?

need to check for sysconf for system driver, otherwise we're going to have a 256 fd limit

3) fix race 
4) Add driver operation cancel, for ANY op
   -- it takes context, if op is not greater than context, then fail
5) pass open in accept
6) add globus_assert(result != success || prev_res == success)
