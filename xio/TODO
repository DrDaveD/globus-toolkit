attr only on server init and open

get rid of context in transport
get rid of context close

need clean method of getting contact string

get rid of macros so we can hide types

--------------------

add 'no cancel' to the close attr

need a kickout utility for drivers so their driver specific cntls can respect callback space

driver op cancel needs to remember who canceled it so the flag can be reset when it returns to that driver.

also, if something like target init or server accept fails somewhere along the way, the success targets need to be destroyed (same for attr, etc)

6) add globus_assert(result != success || prev_res == success)

-- take ref on driver handle to prevent close barrier
-- something to do with target destroy

should pass close respect cancel?  definitely not when TOP LEVEL op is open

caching shit needs to be finished

dont do unnecessary error_get/puts

reexamine build process
