contact string details

reexamine build process

remove context from transport and hide context else where

drivers should take globus_url_t instead of string contact string

need clean method of getting contact string

need a kickout utility for drivers so their driver specific cntls can respect callback space

po canceled by driver then op bounces down bug

need to add driver_attr_cntl also

Pass Accept, get back,  pass_open, get back, pass_read... does that work?
