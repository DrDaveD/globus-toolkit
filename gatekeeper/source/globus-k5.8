.SH "NAME"
globus-k5 \- Acquire Kerberos Credentials for use with Grid Services
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 10
\fBglobus\-k5\fR \fISERVICE\-COMMAND\fR [\fISERVICE\-ARGS\fR...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBglobus\-k5\fR
program is an authorization module used by the
\fBglobus\-gatekeeper\fR
program to acquire Kerberos 5 Credentials prior to executing a Grid Service\&. This may be accomplished by running
\fBkinit\fR
with a password stored in the
\fIglobuskmap\fR
file, using the NCSA
\fBkrb525\fR
command, or the
\fBsslk5\fR
command to use the X509 user proxy\&.
.PP
The arguments passed to
\fBglobus\-k5\fR
will not be used by it, but will be passed onto the job manager\&. The first parameter must be the path to the Grid Service\&.
.PP
It is expected that the environment will contain the variables
\fBGLOBUSID\fR
and
\fBUSER\fR
for the Grid and local POSIX user identities\&. This program is normally run as root, and will call seteuid() prior to executing the Grid Service\&.
.PP
The parameters to use and the mapping for the globus to K5 user are located in the
\fIglobuskmap\fR
file\&.
.SH "FORMAT OF THE GLOBUSKMAP FILE"
.PP
The globuskmap file is a line\-oriented file which each line containing a command to run to acquire Kerberos 5 credentials for a Grid identity\&. Each line consists of an optionally\-quoted
\fIGLOBUSID\fR
value followed by a command\-line for running a process to acquire a Kerberos credential\&. For example:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
"/O=Example/OU=Grid/CN=Joe User" /usr/afsws/bin/klog \-principal juser \-password mypasswd \-cell infn\&.it
.fi
.RE
.sp
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.PP
If the following variables affect the execution of
\fBglobus\-k5\fR:
.PP
GLOBUSKMAP
.RS 4
Path to the globuskmap file\&.
.RE
.PP
USER
.RS 4
POSIX username that the service will run as\&.
.RE
.PP
KRB5CCNAME
.RS 4
Path to a Kerberos credential cache\&.
.RE
.PP
GLOBUS_ID
.RS 4
Grid identity to generate Kerberos credentials for\&.
.RE
.SH "FILES"
.PP
.PP
\fI/etc/globuskmap\fR
.RS 4
Default file mapping Grid identities to Kerberos 5 principals\&.
