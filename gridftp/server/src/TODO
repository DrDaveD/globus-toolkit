Other Stuff
------------
file not trunc on striped puts, since they all look like partials, also
    truncating on pasv stor... who truncates, and have to deal with
    data coming before the 150 response

clean up rest of stuff from pre-dsi change (old attrs that just copy to new
    info structs, etc)

-produce netlogger output (based on event timer i guess?... -Z option in wu)
-global config opts can be non-overridable, or forced to a range
-sync(2) before each transfer stat update (by option only, unless it doesn't affect perf)
