This is the current list of things outstanding for the 4.0 release.
** denotes must happen before feature freeze
XX denotes unlikely that this will be in 4.0

auth:
XX authz instrumentation

protocol:
-- correct FEAT response?
-- reply codes - verify.
-- disable perf markers in mode S (if we must)
** define reply errors properly for going over ipc
-- error out usefully to server and client when cred problem in gssapi driver
-- add blocksize and stripeblocksize via client (diableable)

signal handling:
-- SIGINT needs to handle data-node shutdown

striping:
-- verify eofc handling, should move out of remote into data.c
-- verify _get_read_range()
-- consolidate some restart ranges instead of sending one from every stripe

ipc:
XX connect backwards

logging:
-- instrument code
-- verify output format
-- specify log format by configuration
-- configuration to choose logging module
-- syslog module for globus_logging
-- produce netlogger output based on perf marker info ( -Z option in wu )

general:
-- instrument any remaining configuration options and limits

threads:
-- quick test that stuff works -- not really looking for 100% right now
-- walk through locks

cleanup:
-- verify test suite
-- clean majority of memory leaks

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
known bugs:
-- op used in data_session_start isn't freed
-- we don't chdir to the users home directory on successful auth, which 
    should at least be an option.  There is no way to set a cwd in the 
    server-lib though?
-- -s option (non-detached fork) has a problem where children don't die
-- ipc local mode doesn't work (besides no way to initiate it)
-- not calling _finish() in data.c for some request funcs that fail before
    the dsi call.
