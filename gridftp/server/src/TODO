This is the current list of things outstanding for the 4.0 release.

protocol:
-- correct FEAT response?
-- reply codes - verify.
-- verify that dsi api is correct wrt to errors
-- notify server of error when cred problem in gssapi_ftp driver

striping:
-- verify eofc handling, see if we can move out of dsi into data.c
-- optimize _get_read_range()
-- consolidate some restart ranges instead of sending one from every stripe
-- need some spec compliant support for partitioned layout
    current stripeblocksize impl is basically spec compliant RR
    
logging:
-- instrument code
-- verify output format
-- clean up transfer and usage logging

other:
-- send a connection denied message to connections we don't want to accept, 
    rather than ignoring the accept.

cleanup:
-- format -help screen
-- verify test suite
-- find leaks in error cases
-- DOC
-- remove hpss modules

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
known issues:
-- errors in some control.c requests will hang -- need to finish() there
-- error out of option parsing properly
-- ipc failure while the handle is owned by the dsi destroys the handle. should
    not free until user calls release or close, and just error out of any other
    calls that attempt to use the handle. (verify fixed?)
-- need to make sure ints in various places are change to size_t if they
    need to be, and on passing size_t's over ipc need to do some smarts
    to treat it as 4 or 8 bytes... possible probs if sizes differ on front
    and back?  This is specifically a problem with tcp_bs, we treat it as an
    int on the server side, but server-lib gives it to us as a size_t (as
    it probably should), which is a different size on most 64 bit platforms.
-- problem with preauth timeout    
-- there may be an issue with group permissions -- not sure if it results
    in any problems.
-- closing connections reports an xio error when the connection was closed
    normally.  possibly an xio/cancel problem.
-- ipc connections with security enabled (default) aren't being cached
    correctly, results in IPC ERRORs as the client closes.
-- detach check is before config file is read, so detach in config file
    doesn't work.  also possible other issues with config checks at 
    fork/exec time when using only config file.
-- server exec name discovery fails when there is not a valid $GL. -exec
    flag works around this, but not ideal.





future:
-- alternate ipc connection modes
-- ipc local mode
-- specify log format by configuration
